My GitHub account will be used for my academic classes at Wake Tech Community College.

The repository that I created was for my lab assignment in CTI-110 labelled "Lesson 5: GitHub Lab"

The steps that I took to clone my repository are as followed: 

Step 1: Open the source code in the GitHub desktop app.

Step 2: On the main menu, click on "Clone existing repository from the internet"

Step 3: Choose a directory path in File Explorer to copy the repository into.
