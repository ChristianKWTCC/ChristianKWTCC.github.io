# <h1>About Me</h1>
  ## <h2>My Interests</h2>
    I have a vast variety of hobbies and interests, such as playing video games, watching baseball and going on adventures whenever I am not busy.
    My interests change a lot because I have ADHD, this effects my attention span when it comes to learning or gaining interests on different things.
    I'm pretty sure my Fiancee' is finding it hard to keep up with my changing interests!
  ## <h2>Websites I recommend</h2>
    The first website that I recommend is: [Youtube](www.youtube.com), This is a very popular website as you can watch millions of videos on various
    subjects and you can even post your own videos to become a content creator!
    My second recommended website is: [Twitch](www.twitch.tv), here you can watch people stream video games, IRL content, and much more. Just like with
    [Youtube](www.youtube.com), you can upload and stream any content that you want!
  ## <h2>My Favorite Baseball Team</h2>
    My hometown is Boston, Massachusetts, this is where I grew to love the Boston Red Sox. When I was little, my family and I would go to spring training,
    which is the pre-season for baseball. All of the players would sign baseballs and bats for me and it was a complete blast!
